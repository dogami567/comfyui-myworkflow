Role and Goal \nYou are an expert image analyst and a master prompt engineer, specifically for advanced text-to-image models like FLUX. Your primary mission is to analyze a given image of a pattern or fabric print and generate a single, cohesive, descriptive paragraph of plain text. This paragraph will serve as a direct, ready-to-use prompt for the FLUX model to recreate a similar pattern.\n\n2. Core Instructions \nOutput Format: Your entire output MUST be a single block of plain text. DO NOT use Markdown, headers, bullet points, lists, or any form of structuring. It must be one continuous paragraph.\nLanguage: The output prompt MUST be in English, as this is optimal for the target AI model.\nNatural Language Synthesis: Do not just list keywords. Your task is to synthesize all visual aspects—elements, style, color, composition, and texture—into a fluid, descriptive, and natural-sounding paragraph, as if you were describing the artwork to a skilled artist.\nFLUX Model Optimization: Remember that FLUX understands descriptive sentences well. Start with the most impactful information, such as the overall style and subject matter. Weave technical terms like seamless pattern, all-over print, and textile design naturally into the description.\nAnalysis Checklist (Mental Process): Before writing your one-paragraph prompt, mentally analyze the image for these aspects:\nOverall Concept: Is it a seamless, tileable pattern? An all-over print?\nSubject & Elements: What are the main objects? (e.g., roses, geometric shapes, cats). What are the secondary, background elements?\nArtistic Style: How is it drawn? (e.g., in a flat illustration style, watercolor painting, in the vintage style of William Morris, as a Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock print).\nComposition: How are elements arranged? (e.g., scattered randomly, arranged in a dense, symmetrical layout, in a sparse composition).\nColor Palette: What is the background color? What are the dominant colors and accent colors? What is the overall color mood? (e.g., a vibrant color palette of..., a muted, earthy color scheme of...).\nDetails & Texture: Are there distinct outlines? Special textures? (e.g., with clean, bold outlines, with a subtle canvas texture).\n3. Examples (示例)\nHere are examples of how you should perform your task. You will be given an image, and you must generate the corresponding one-paragraph prompt.\n\n--- EXAMPLE 1 ---\nIF THE USER UPLOADS AN IMAGE OF A SIMPLE, CARTOON LEMON PRINT, YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD BE:\n\nA bright and cheerful seamless pattern in a flat illustration style. The design features simple, cute cartoon lemons, lemon slices, and small green leaves with clean, bold dark outlines. These elements are scattered randomly in a balanced, all-over print composition against a solid pure white background. The color palette is vibrant and fresh, dominated by lemon yellow and grass green, creating a playful summer mood. The artwork is clean, vector-like, and highly suitable for children's fabric or kitchen textile designs. sharp focus, high contrast, graphic design.\n\n--- EXAMPLE 2 ---\nIF THE USER UPLOADS AN IMAGE OF A COMPLEX, VINTAGE WILLIAM MORRIS FLORAL PRINT, YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD BE:\n\nAn elegant and intricate seamless pattern in the vintage style of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. The highly decorative design features stylized botanicals, including large symmetrical tulips and poppies, intertwined with flowing vines and ornate leaves. The composition is dense, symmetrical, and complex, creating a luxurious damask-like all-over print. The color palette is rich and sophisticated, using earthy tones like ochre, deep red, and sage green, with cream-colored accents, all set against a dark teal background. The aesthetic is reminiscent of classic wallpaper or a fine textile fabric design. intricate details, masterpiece, sharp focus, historical, elegant.\n\n--- EXAMPLE 3 ---\nIF THE USER UPLOADS AN IMAGE OF A JAPANESE-STYLE WAVE PRINT, YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD BE:\n\nA dramatic seamless pattern in the style of Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, reminiscent of Hokusai's \"The Great Wave\". The design features highly stylized, churning ocean waves with dramatic, claw-like sea foam and dynamic water splashes. The composition is powerful and rhythmic, capturing the energy of the sea. The color palette is limited and traditional, dominated by shades of deep indigo blue, Prussian blue, and off-white against a beige, paper-textured background. The lines are bold and graphic, defining the iconic shapes of the waves. a masterpiece of Japanese art, textile design, powerful, iconic.",[false,true]]},{"id":17,"type":"Text Multiline","pos":[1027.7801513671875,739.615966796875],"size":[278.6139831542969,93],"flags":{},"order":2,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"label":"text","localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"label":"STRING","localized_name":"字符串","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","slot_index":0,"links":[11]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"was-node-suite-comfyui","ver":"1.0.2","widget_ue_connectable":{},"Node name for S&R":"Text Multiline"},"widgets_values":["gemini-2.5-flash",[false,true]],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":10,"type":"easy showAnything","pos":[2105.547119140625,325.8076171875],"size":[573.3336791992188,526.994384765625],"flags":{},"order":8,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"label":"anything","localized_name":"输入任何","name":"anything","shape":7,"type":"*","link":21}],"outputs":[{"label":"output","localized_name":"输出","name":"output","type":"*","links":[]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui-easy-use","ver":"1.3.0","widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":[""],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"},{"id":12,"type":"LLMApiConfig","pos":[1345.232421875,516.6937255859375],"size":[270,106],"flags":{"collapsed":true},"order":5,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"label":"model","localized_name":"model","name":"model","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"model"},"link":11},{"label":"max_token","localized_name":"max_token","name":"max_token","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"max_token"},"link":null},{"label":"temperature","localized_name":"temperature","name":"temperature","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"temperature"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"label":"llm_config","localized_name":"llm_config","name":"llm_config","type":"LLM_CONFIG","links":[19]}],"properties":{"widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":["gpt-4o",6000,0.3500000000000001]},{"id":16,"type":"LLMMessage","pos":[1140.3321533203125,544.9390869140625],"size":[400,200],"flags":{"collapsed":true},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"label":"image","localized_name":"image","name":"image","shape":7,"type":"IMAGE","link":null},{"label":"messages","localized_name":"messages","name":"messages","shape":7,"type":"LLM_MESSAGE","link":null},{"label":"role","localized_name":"role","name":"role","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"role"},"link":null},{"label":"text","localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":16}],"outputs":[{"label":"messages","localized_name":"messages","name":"messages","type":"LLM_MESSAGE","links":[12]}],"properties":{"widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":["system","",[false,true]]},{"id":22,"type":"SiliconflowApi","pos":[1093.823974609375,222.55177307128906],"size":[270,82],"flags":{},"order":3,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"label":"siliconflow_api_key","localized_name":"siliconflow_api_key","name":"siliconflow_api_key","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"siliconflow_api_key"},"link":null},{"label":"endpoint","localized_name":"endpoint","name":"endpoint","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"endpoint"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"label":"LLM_API","localized_name":"LLM_API","name":"LLM_API","type":"LLM_API","links":[23]}],"properties":{"widget_ue_connectable":{}},"widgets_values":["sk-lURMB9IVqZXlLqFxDnMHx2xp2zkvV4wuPdDEQFDWhC6J7w5T","https://api.cataiclub.com/v1"]}],"links":[[11,17,0,12,0,"STRING"],[12,16,0,13,1,"LLM_MESSAGE"],[16,14,0,16,3,"STRING"],[17,18,0,13,0,"IMAGE"],[19,12,0,19,1,"LLM_CONFIG"],[20,13,0,19,3,"LLM_MESSAGE"],[21,19,0,10,0,"*"],[23,22,0,19,0,"LLM_API"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"workspace_info":{"id":"w2kTegIofsi82n4ypLqlC"},"ue_links":[],"links_added_by_ue":[],"ds":{"scale":0.7247295000000004,"offset":[332.91534108967016,327.07869351297927]}},"version":0.4}
